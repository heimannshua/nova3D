# Implementation Constraints

Read the [project SPEC](../spec-nova3D/SPEC.md) and every companion it names recursively. Implement only this story's declared slice. Mapped requirements constrain the touched behavior; their other slices remain assigned to the other stories.

## Governing Interpretation

Ratified R-1–R-11 and approved SC-1–SC-7 override conflicting older PRD wording. Whole-plan approval and deterministic recipe equivalence apply to evidence_text/evidence_images. Direct image work uses confirmed ordered images/scope and acknowledged uncertainty, with honest inference provenance and restorable snapshots; it has no synthetic Research Plan or identical-reinference guarantee. Exact-model approval and required profile checks gate qualified export in every mode.

Prepared offline work follows the adopted no-lease/reconnect policy: learned disable locks until newer authoritative re-enable, learned tombstones purge before import, and network uncertainty alone is not deletion. R-11 permits one atomically consumed full fallback slot per lineage. The parent contract supplies every detailed authority, money, geometry, lifecycle and UX invariant.

## Mapped Requirements

### FR-5

#### FR-5: Natural-language project intake

An Account can start a Project by describing the desired model in ordinary language without finding or uploading source texts.

**Consequences:**
- If the request permits materially different subjects, periods, scopes, or outcomes, nova3D asks clarifying questions before starting paid research.
- The user sees and confirms nova3D's understanding of the Project scope.

Source: PRD §4, FR-5.

**Ratified application:** SC-1 also requires ordered multi-view picture intake and the two explicit picture modes; natural-language intake does not defer them.

### FR-14

#### FR-14: Research mode and paid escalation

The user can choose per Project whether research may use paid services or must remain free-only.

**Consequences:**
- nova3D cannot start paid research without explicit user permission.
- Paid research is also subject to the Account's Usage Limit.
- If free-only research cannot resolve complete Consequential Detail coverage, nova3D shows the remaining gaps and asks whether to switch the Project to paid research.
- Declining paid escalation leaves the Project unready for Plan Approval while blocking gaps remain.
- Before research begins, the user separately chooses whether to reuse available cached research or research the subject again from scratch.
- Cached results show their original research date, immutable revision identity, and cached status; nova3D does not automatically re-verify them.
- A correction creates a new Cached Research Revision linked to its predecessor; it never changes an existing revision in place.
- An approved Project remains pinned to the revision it used. Adopting a successor revision creates a new Research Plan version and requires renewed Plan Approval before regeneration.
- Paid research also follows the Paid Work permission, disclosure, Usage Limit, and reservation rules in FR-4.

### AR-17

**AR-17: Provider boundary and uncertain charges.** Adopt Anthropic Messages claude-sonnet-5-5 for evidence synthesis/vision and Brave Web Search v1 for discovery behind adapters, with version/rate/account-term verification before enablement; the Brave adapter stays disabled until its terms are reviewed, and a Brave result is transient discovery input only. Search receives normalized public subjects only; vision receives only permissioned purpose-required data. No paid external 3D provider, Files/Batch/Managed Agents storage, private raw prompts in search, or billable free-credit fallback in free-only mode. Own hosting/storage/worker/local inference is instance overhead. The reservation is a calculator-computed bound over a provider-independent input bound and the output limit actually sent; the per-call ceilings (200,000 input tokens, 16,000 output tokens, 20 search requests per step) are admission limits, and cache, batch, server-tool, fallback and speed options are unsupported. Persist external identity before dispatch; an ambiguous outcome (transport loss, timeout, 5xx, aborted stream) retains its full reservation until usage evidence or a 24-hour reconciliation deadline and then settles at the reservation, a definitive pre-processing rejection with a request ID is documented noncharge, and evidence above a reservation settles at the evidence and blocks further admissions for that provider until reviewed; corrections append ledger entries without replacement calls.

### SC-1

##### SC-1: Picture workflows move into the first version

The PRD deferred picture workflows. The first version now includes both:

- **Direct picture-to-model:** labelled image-derived and not historically verified.
- **Research-assisted picture reconstruction:** identifies the subject, researches it, builds a complete Research Plan, and follows Plan Approval before evidence-backed generation.

Picture intake supports existing images, phone camera capture, and multiple images of one subject from different angles. Before conversion, nova3D checks clarity and angle coverage and recommends additional views. The user may choose **Generate anyway** after an explicit warning that incomplete views can cause invented or inaccurate geometry.

Source: UX-SCOPE-CHANGES SC-1; canonical ux-contract; applicable ratified decisions.

Source: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md`, line 483 in the captured input.

### UX-DR8

**UX-DR8: Intake sequence and paid consent.** Confirm subject, scope, outcome, picture mode and personalization after text/image intake. For research, separately select free/paid and cache/fresh afterward, before dispatch. Present provider/category/purpose, outbound-data/retention and maximum before paid permission. Scope confirmation, start confirmation, Plan Approval and Model Approval remain distinct.

Source: UX-2; FR-4/FR-5/FR-14.

Source: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md`, line 807 in the captured input.

### UX-DR34

**UX-DR34: Picture quality and coverage (C-04).** Explain blur, obstruction, or missing angles and recommend better/additional views.

Required states/variants: Sufficient, insufficient, additional view requested, **Generate anyway** warning.

Source: SCREEN-INVENTORY C-04; canonical ux-contract; applicable ratified decisions.

## Planning Assumptions

- Story boundaries and the proposed order are delegated fast-path planning choices inferred from ratified requirements, not separately claimed user approvals.
- Evidence-backed generation and export can be implemented without waiting for the direct reconstruction engine; full first-version release still requires both picture modes and qualified offline/device behavior.
- Each story creates only the records and interfaces needed by its slice; later features inherit live authorization, immutable provenance, money, lifecycle and accessible UI contracts.
- Per-story specs have local stable CAP IDs and adopt the unchanged project-wide contract. No implementation dispatch, spec_checkpoint or done_checkpoint defaults are set in this planning run.
- Exact compatible patches, deployed resources, licensed font files and reconstruction weights remain delegated selections within adopted limits; missing qualifying evidence is engineering work, not a newly invented product question.

## Qualification Snapshot — September 14, 2026

| Gate | Recorded status |
| --- | --- |
| G-1 | PARTIAL |
| G-2 | PARTIAL |
| G-3 | PARTIAL |
| G-4 | NOT RUN |
| G-5 | BLOCKED |
| G-6 | PARTIAL |
| G-7 | NOT RUN |
| G-8 | BLOCKED |
| G-9 | PARTIAL |

Only actual qualifying evidence changes these statuses. Creating or validating a story spec does not pass an engineering gate. A missing offline engine or device result remains release-blocking under the adopted scope.
