# Implementation Constraints

Read the [project SPEC](../spec-nova3D/SPEC.md) and every companion it names recursively. Implement only this story's declared slice. Mapped requirements constrain the touched behavior; their other slices remain assigned to the other stories.

## Governing Interpretation

Ratified R-1–R-11 and approved SC-1–SC-7 override conflicting older PRD wording. Whole-plan approval and deterministic recipe equivalence apply to evidence_text/evidence_images. Direct image work uses confirmed ordered images/scope and acknowledged uncertainty, with honest inference provenance and restorable snapshots; it has no synthetic Research Plan or identical-reinference guarantee. Exact-model approval and required profile checks gate qualified export in every mode.

Prepared offline work follows the adopted no-lease/reconnect policy: learned disable locks until newer authoritative re-enable, learned tombstones purge before import, and network uncertainty alone is not deletion. R-11 permits one atomically consumed full fallback slot per lineage. The parent contract supplies every detailed authority, money, geometry, lifecycle and UX invariant.

## Mapped Requirements

### FR-2

#### FR-2: Authentication and workspace isolation

An Account can authenticate and access only its own Workspace.

**Consequences:**
- Cross-Account access to Projects, Sources, decisions, Models, Versions, Jobs, Exports, and Notifications is denied.
- Administrative usage controls do not expose ordinary Project content.
- The Administrator cannot impersonate an Account, browse its private Workspace, or assign additional administrative privileges through the app.

Source: PRD §4, FR-2.

Source: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md`, line 85 in the captured input.

### FR-3

#### FR-3: Account administration

The Administrator can view Account status and disable or re-enable an invited Account.

**Consequences:**
- Disabling an Account immediately revokes every active session and download authorization.
- A disabled Account cannot authenticate, access its Workspace, or start operations or paid steps.
- Disabling safely cancels active Jobs and rejects any late result so it cannot mutate Workspace or cache state.
- Disabling an Account does not delete its Workspace.
- Administrative capabilities are limited to issuing and revoking Invitation Codes, viewing account status and usage, setting Usage Limits, and disabling or re-enabling Accounts.
- Invitation, Usage Limit, disable, re-enable, and recovery actions require fresh Administrator authentication and create immutable security audit events.
- The unique Administrator can recover access only through a single-use, short-lived link sent to the Administrator's verified email address.
- Successful Administrator recovery revokes all existing Administrator sessions and creates an immutable recovery audit event.

Source: PRD §4, FR-3.

**Ratified application:** R-8 / AR-23 governs already-local disconnected data: server access is revoked immediately, while a disconnected device learns disable/deletion on contact. A learned disable cannot be bypassed by returning offline.

Source: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md`, line 96 in the captured input.

### FR-29

#### FR-29: Model and provenance export

The user can download an Export for a Model Version that has Model Approval and a passing validation result.

**Consequences:**
- The Export contains a 3MF file as its primary print-ready model, offers an optional STL compatibility copy, and includes a readable PDF Source Record.
- The Source Record identifies the Project, Research Plan, Consequential Details, Claims, Sources, reasoning, options, approvals, Personalization, Canonical Model identity, Model Version, Target Print Profile, validations, and repairs.
- The PDF uses stable identifiers and cross-references so the user can trace Claims to Model Features and Model Features back to Claims; it is generated from the same immutable structured provenance used by the app.
- The Export remains linked to its Source Record and structured provenance even though the print file may not contain editable parametric history.

Source: PRD §4, FR-29.

**Ratified application:** The immutable export carries mode-appropriate provenance, never a fabricated historical plan for direct images. R-4 defines shared structured provenance plus PDF; R-8 requires connection for qualified export.

Source: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md`, line 430 in the captured input.

### AR-19

**AR-19: Revocable artifact transfer.** Keep buckets private and use ownership-scoped immutable keys and quota/lease-bounded upload staging. Verify checksums/content before attachment. Container gateway streams large uploads/downloads/ranges; authorize each range and every chunk of at most 1 MiB against live Account/session/Project/artifact state. Do not expose reusable signed download URLs or cache private responses/authorization; stop future chunks on revocation. Delivered or in-flight bytes cannot be recalled. Cleanup respects active leases.

Source: AD-13; file authorization.

Source: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md`, line 657 in the captured input.

### NFR-1

**NFR-1: Workspace privacy.** Every user-facing and background operation enforces Account ownership. Cross-Account access to private Workspace data must produce no data disclosure.

Source: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md`, line 541 in the captured input.

### NFR-2

**NFR-2: Secret protection.** Login, Invitation Code, recovery, provider, database, queue, signing, and callback-verification secrets are never stored or logged in readable form or exposed through browsers, URLs, prompts, Jobs, Notifications, Source Records, or Exports. Sensitive authentication actions require secure transport and protected sessions. Secrets support redaction, rotation, and revocation.

Source: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md`, line 543 in the captured input.

### UX-DR63

**UX-DR63: Export download (V-06).** Primary 3MF, optional STL, readable PDF Source Record.

Required states/variants: Preparing, ready, individual/package download, failed, phone file handling.

Source: SCREEN-INVENTORY V-06; canonical ux-contract; applicable ratified decisions.

Source: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md`, line 1111 in the captured input.

## Planning Assumptions

- Story boundaries and the proposed order are delegated fast-path planning choices inferred from ratified requirements, not separately claimed user approvals.
- Evidence-backed generation and export can be implemented without waiting for the direct reconstruction engine; full first-version release still requires both picture modes and qualified offline/device behavior.
- Each story creates only the records and interfaces needed by its slice; later features inherit live authorization, immutable provenance, money, lifecycle and accessible UI contracts.
- Per-story specs have local stable CAP IDs and adopt the unchanged project-wide contract. No implementation dispatch, spec_checkpoint or done_checkpoint defaults are set in this planning run.
- Exact compatible patches, deployed resources, licensed font files and reconstruction weights remain delegated selections within adopted limits; missing qualifying evidence is engineering work, not a newly invented product question.

## Qualification Snapshot — September 14, 2026

| Gate | Recorded status |
| --- | --- |
| G-1 | PARTIAL |
| G-2 | PARTIAL |
| G-3 | PARTIAL |
| G-4 | NOT RUN |
| G-5 | BLOCKED |
| G-6 | PARTIAL |
| G-7 | NOT RUN |
| G-8 | BLOCKED |
| G-9 | PARTIAL |

Only actual qualifying evidence changes these statuses. Creating or validating a story spec does not pass an engineering gate. A missing offline engine or device result remains release-blocking under the adopted scope.
