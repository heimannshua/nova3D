# Implementation Constraints

Read the [project SPEC](../spec-nova3D/SPEC.md) and every companion it names recursively. Implement only this story's declared slice. Mapped requirements constrain the touched behavior; their other slices remain assigned to the other stories.

## Governing Interpretation

Ratified R-1–R-11 and approved SC-1–SC-7 override conflicting older PRD wording. Whole-plan approval and deterministic recipe equivalence apply to evidence_text/evidence_images. Direct image work uses confirmed ordered images/scope and acknowledged uncertainty, with honest inference provenance and restorable snapshots; it has no synthetic Research Plan or identical-reinference guarantee. Exact-model approval and required profile checks gate qualified export in every mode.

Prepared offline work follows the adopted no-lease/reconnect policy: learned disable locks until newer authoritative re-enable, learned tombstones purge before import, and network uncertainty alone is not deletion. R-11 permits one atomically consumed full fallback slot per lineage. The parent contract supplies every detailed authority, money, geometry, lifecycle and UX invariant.

## Mapped Requirements

### FR-2

#### FR-2: Authentication and workspace isolation

An Account can authenticate and access only its own Workspace.

**Consequences:**
- Cross-Account access to Projects, Sources, decisions, Models, Versions, Jobs, Exports, and Notifications is denied.
- Administrative usage controls do not expose ordinary Project content.
- The Administrator cannot impersonate an Account, browse its private Workspace, or assign additional administrative privileges through the app.

Source: PRD §4, FR-2.

Source: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md`, line 85 in the captured input.

### AR-3

**AR-3: Transactional contracts.** Use auth-derived Account, UUID command/event/revision identities, expected revisions, SHA-256 content roots and UTC timestamps. Validate schema, ownership and idempotency; replay returns the original receipt and changed payload under the same ID is rejected. Commit business state, Job/reservation and outbox together. Sensitive tables deny browser DML; ownership-scoped foreign keys prevent cross-Workspace links. Redis, queues and client state cannot authorize transitions.

Source: AD-2; Consistency Conventions.

Source: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md`, line 583 in the captured input.

### AR-18

**AR-18: Identity and administrative enforcement.** Disable public Supabase signup; hash/atomically claim invitations and idempotently provision Auth plus Workspace with unusable partial activation. Rate-limit guessing; rotate shared codes only after success. Verify JWT plus live Account and session grant on every private path, including direct RLS/storage access. The sole Administrator cannot impersonate, inspect private Workspaces or grant more administrators. Sensitive actions require fresh authentication and immutable audit; verified-email single-use short-lived recovery revokes prior sessions.

Source: AD-12; FR-1–FR-4.

Source: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md`, line 653 in the captured input.

### NFR-1

**NFR-1: Workspace privacy.** Every user-facing and background operation enforces Account ownership. Cross-Account access to private Workspace data must produce no data disclosure.

Source: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md`, line 541 in the captured input.

### NFR-2

**NFR-2: Secret protection.** Login, Invitation Code, recovery, provider, database, queue, signing, and callback-verification secrets are never stored or logged in readable form or exposed through browsers, URLs, prompts, Jobs, Notifications, Source Records, or Exports. Sensitive authentication actions require secure transport and protected sessions. Secrets support redaction, rotation, and revocation.

Source: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md`, line 543 in the captured input.

### UX-DR21

**UX-DR21: Sign in (A-01).** Account authentication, recovery entry, language access.

Required states/variants: Default, invalid credentials, disabled Account, loading.

Source: SCREEN-INVENTORY A-01; canonical ux-contract; applicable ratified decisions.

Source: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md`, line 859 in the captured input.

## Planning Assumptions

- Story boundaries and the proposed order are delegated fast-path planning choices inferred from ratified requirements, not separately claimed user approvals.
- Evidence-backed generation and export can be implemented without waiting for the direct reconstruction engine; full first-version release still requires both picture modes and qualified offline/device behavior.
- Each story creates only the records and interfaces needed by its slice; later features inherit live authorization, immutable provenance, money, lifecycle and accessible UI contracts.
- Per-story specs have local stable CAP IDs and adopt the unchanged project-wide contract. No implementation dispatch, spec_checkpoint or done_checkpoint defaults are set in this planning run.
- Exact compatible patches, deployed resources, licensed font files and reconstruction weights remain delegated selections within adopted limits; missing qualifying evidence is engineering work, not a newly invented product question.

## Qualification Snapshot — September 14, 2026

| Gate | Recorded status |
| --- | --- |
| G-1 | PARTIAL |
| G-2 | PARTIAL |
| G-3 | PARTIAL |
| G-4 | NOT RUN |
| G-5 | BLOCKED |
| G-6 | PARTIAL |
| G-7 | NOT RUN |
| G-8 | BLOCKED |
| G-9 | PARTIAL |

Only actual qualifying evidence changes these statuses. Creating or validating a story spec does not pass an engineering gate. A missing offline engine or device result remains release-blocking under the adopted scope.
