# Implementation Constraints

Read the [project SPEC](../spec-nova3D/SPEC.md) and every companion it names recursively. Implement only this story's declared slice. Mapped requirements constrain the touched behavior; their other slices remain assigned to the other stories.

## Governing Interpretation

Ratified R-1–R-11 and approved SC-1–SC-7 override conflicting older PRD wording. Whole-plan approval and deterministic recipe equivalence apply to evidence_text/evidence_images. Direct image work uses confirmed ordered images/scope and acknowledged uncertainty, with honest inference provenance and restorable snapshots; it has no synthetic Research Plan or identical-reinference guarantee. Exact-model approval and required profile checks gate qualified export in every mode.

Prepared offline work follows the adopted no-lease/reconnect policy: learned disable locks until newer authoritative re-enable, learned tombstones purge before import, and network uncertainty alone is not deletion. R-11 permits one atomically consumed full fallback slot per lineage. The parent contract supplies every detailed authority, money, geometry, lifecycle and UX invariant.

## Mapped Requirements

### FR-3

#### FR-3: Account administration

The Administrator can view Account status and disable or re-enable an invited Account.

**Consequences:**
- Disabling an Account immediately revokes every active session and download authorization.
- A disabled Account cannot authenticate, access its Workspace, or start operations or paid steps.
- Disabling safely cancels active Jobs and rejects any late result so it cannot mutate Workspace or cache state.
- Disabling an Account does not delete its Workspace.
- Administrative capabilities are limited to issuing and revoking Invitation Codes, viewing account status and usage, setting Usage Limits, and disabling or re-enabling Accounts.
- Invitation, Usage Limit, disable, re-enable, and recovery actions require fresh Administrator authentication and create immutable security audit events.
- The unique Administrator can recover access only through a single-use, short-lived link sent to the Administrator's verified email address.
- Successful Administrator recovery revokes all existing Administrator sessions and creates an immutable recovery audit event.

Source: PRD §4, FR-3.

**Ratified application:** R-8 / AR-23 governs already-local disconnected data: server access is revoked immediately, while a disconnected device learns disable/deletion on contact. A learned disable cannot be bypassed by returning offline.

### AR-15

**AR-15: Fencing and authenticated service calls.** Each attempt binds input digest, Project revision, live Account authorization/evidence-policy epochs, lease and unique fencing token. Recheck before claim, each external step and publication. Cancel/disable/delete revoke commit authority before best-effort cancellation; stage output by attempt and clean it without publishing late results. Signed service requests bind environment, audience, Job/attempt, payload digest and nonce, expire within five minutes and allow at most 60 seconds skew. Verify native callback signatures and stored dispatch receipts; never infer callback identity from Project ID alone. Accept only the active signing key and one explicitly retiring key during the outstanding-request window; suspected compromise immediately revokes the key and affected leases. Reject replay mutations.

Source: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md`, line 641 in the captured input.

### AR-18

**AR-18: Identity and administrative enforcement.** Disable public Supabase signup; hash/atomically claim invitations and idempotently provision Auth plus Workspace with unusable partial activation. Rate-limit guessing; rotate shared codes only after success. Verify JWT plus live Account and session grant on every private path, including direct RLS/storage access. The sole Administrator cannot impersonate, inspect private Workspaces or grant more administrators. Sensitive actions require fresh authentication and immutable audit; verified-email single-use short-lived recovery revokes prior sessions.

Source: AD-12; FR-1–FR-4.

Source: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md`, line 653 in the captured input.

### NFR-1

**NFR-1: Workspace privacy.** Every user-facing and background operation enforces Account ownership. Cross-Account access to private Workspace data must produce no data disclosure.

Source: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md`, line 541 in the captured input.

### NFR-2

**NFR-2: Secret protection.** Login, Invitation Code, recovery, provider, database, queue, signing, and callback-verification secrets are never stored or logged in readable form or exposed through browsers, URLs, prompts, Jobs, Notifications, Source Records, or Exports. Sensitive authentication actions require secure transport and protected sessions. Secrets support redaction, rotation, and revocation.

Source: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md`, line 543 in the captured input.

### UX-DR70

**UX-DR70: Account administration (AD-02).** Account status, disable/re-enable, no private Workspace access.

Required states/variants: Enabled, disabling, disabled, re-enabled, active Jobs cancelled.

Source: SCREEN-INVENTORY AD-02; canonical ux-contract; applicable ratified decisions.

Source: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md`, line 1153 in the captured input.

### UX-DR72

**UX-DR72: Administrator recovery/security (AD-04).** Sensitive actions require fresh authentication and create audit events.

Required states/variants: Reauthentication, success, failure, session revoked.

Source: SCREEN-INVENTORY AD-04; canonical ux-contract; applicable ratified decisions.

Source: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md`, line 1165 in the captured input.

## Planning Assumptions

- Story boundaries and the proposed order are delegated fast-path planning choices inferred from ratified requirements, not separately claimed user approvals.
- Evidence-backed generation and export can be implemented without waiting for the direct reconstruction engine; full first-version release still requires both picture modes and qualified offline/device behavior.
- Each story creates only the records and interfaces needed by its slice; later features inherit live authorization, immutable provenance, money, lifecycle and accessible UI contracts.
- Per-story specs have local stable CAP IDs and adopt the unchanged project-wide contract. No implementation dispatch, spec_checkpoint or done_checkpoint defaults are set in this planning run.
- Exact compatible patches, deployed resources, licensed font files and reconstruction weights remain delegated selections within adopted limits; missing qualifying evidence is engineering work, not a newly invented product question.

## Qualification Snapshot — September 14, 2026

| Gate | Recorded status |
| --- | --- |
| G-1 | PARTIAL |
| G-2 | PARTIAL |
| G-3 | PARTIAL |
| G-4 | NOT RUN |
| G-5 | BLOCKED |
| G-6 | PARTIAL |
| G-7 | NOT RUN |
| G-8 | BLOCKED |
| G-9 | PARTIAL |

Only actual qualifying evidence changes these statuses. Creating or validating a story spec does not pass an engineering gate. A missing offline engine or device result remains release-blocking under the adopted scope.
