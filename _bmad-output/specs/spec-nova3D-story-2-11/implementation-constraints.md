# Implementation Constraints

Read the [project SPEC](../spec-nova3D/SPEC.md) and every companion it names recursively. Implement only this story's declared slice. Mapped requirements constrain the touched behavior; their other slices remain assigned to the other stories.

## Governing Interpretation

Ratified R-1–R-11 and approved SC-1–SC-7 override conflicting older PRD wording. Whole-plan approval and deterministic recipe equivalence apply to evidence_text/evidence_images. Direct image work uses confirmed ordered images/scope and acknowledged uncertainty, with honest inference provenance and restorable snapshots; it has no synthetic Research Plan or identical-reinference guarantee. Exact-model approval and required profile checks gate qualified export in every mode.

Prepared offline work follows the adopted no-lease/reconnect policy: learned disable locks until newer authoritative re-enable, learned tombstones purge before import, and network uncertainty alone is not deletion. R-11 permits one atomically consumed full fallback slot per lineage. The parent contract supplies every detailed authority, money, geometry, lifecycle and UX invariant.

## Mapped Requirements

### FR-6

#### FR-6: Concurrent background jobs

An Account can use other Projects while multiple research or generation Jobs run independently.

**Consequences:**
- Each Job exposes waiting, running, completed, failed, and cancelled states.
- Project data and results cannot leak between concurrent Jobs.
- The user can cancel a Job without damaging previously approved data or Versions.
- Failed Jobs do not retry automatically; they preserve the last approved state, explain the known cause in beginner-friendly language, and wait for a user retry decision.

### AR-3

**AR-3: Transactional contracts.** Use auth-derived Account, UUID command/event/revision identities, expected revisions, SHA-256 content roots and UTC timestamps. Validate schema, ownership and idempotency; replay returns the original receipt and changed payload under the same ID is rejected. Commit business state, Job/reservation and outbox together. Sensitive tables deny browser DML; ownership-scoped foreign keys prevent cross-Workspace links. Redis, queues and client state cannot authorize transitions. Cookie-authenticated mutations require origin and CSRF checks.

Source: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md`, line 616 in the captured input.

### AR-14

**AR-14: Durable Jobs and bounded retries.** Accept Jobs only with committed dispatch outbox; persist Job → JobAttempt → StepExecution → ExternalOperation identities and receipts. Upstash orchestrates bounded HTTP steps and worker completions; Postgres owns state. Configure workflow, explicit queue publishes and provider SDKs for zero failed-work retries, verifying effective behavior with a deliberately failing research step. Duplicate transport returns existing receipts without repeated side effects; terminal failed/cancelled attempts cannot be reclaimed. Lease loss becomes interrupted failure; user retries create new linked attempts under the same Job and wait for prior potentially chargeable work to reconcile. Logical step keys are unique per attempt, and operation ordinals per step; Jobs owns receipts while Usage owns their ledger entries. Preserve last approved state and actionable failure details.

Source: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md`, line 670 in the captured input.

### NFR-4

**NFR-4: Durable job state.** Closing the browser, navigating to another Project, or a worker restart cannot lose an accepted Job, corrupt its Project, or misreport its final state.

Source: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md`, line 580 in the captured input.

### NFR-5

**NFR-5: Safe concurrency.** Concurrent Jobs remain isolated and cannot overwrite newer approved Project state. Results generated from stale inputs cannot silently become current.

## Planning Assumptions

- Story boundaries and the proposed order are delegated fast-path planning choices inferred from ratified requirements, not separately claimed user approvals.
- Evidence-backed generation and export can be implemented without waiting for the direct reconstruction engine; full first-version release still requires both picture modes and qualified offline/device behavior.
- Each story creates only the records and interfaces needed by its slice; later features inherit live authorization, immutable provenance, money, lifecycle and accessible UI contracts.
- Per-story specs have local stable CAP IDs and adopt the unchanged project-wide contract. No implementation dispatch, spec_checkpoint or done_checkpoint defaults are set in this planning run.
- Exact compatible patches, deployed resources, licensed font files and reconstruction weights remain delegated selections within adopted limits; missing qualifying evidence is engineering work, not a newly invented product question.

## Qualification Snapshot — September 14, 2026

| Gate | Recorded status |
| --- | --- |
| G-1 | PARTIAL |
| G-2 | PARTIAL |
| G-3 | PARTIAL |
| G-4 | NOT RUN |
| G-5 | BLOCKED |
| G-6 | PARTIAL |
| G-7 | NOT RUN |
| G-8 | BLOCKED |
| G-9 | PARTIAL |

Only actual qualifying evidence changes these statuses. Creating or validating a story spec does not pass an engineering gate. A missing offline engine or device result remains release-blocking under the adopted scope.
